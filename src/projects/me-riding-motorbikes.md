title: Dan and Rich Riding Motorbikes
---

Over the last couple of years, I've been extremely fortunate enough to tag along with my friend [Rich](https://twitter.com/rtt) when he [reviews motorbikes for GQ](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/profile/rich-taylor?utm_source=danpalmer). He packs all of his motorbike gear whilst I just wear whatever the weather calls for.

_2019-12-20_: This was our first ride in Spain. To be honest my first time on a bike. Rich successfully managed to scare me.

_2019-05-28_: Riding around Lisbon. We had just stopped for croissants. It was good.

_Unknown_: Cobham Services. Rich wasn't happy I need a toilet stop.

_2019-02-09_: Gran Canaria. Both of us enjoyed the warm weather. I managed to grab an ice lolly moments before jumping on. Very joyful it didn't fall out of my hands with some of the corners we took.

_2019-03-02_: We both had the opportunity to visit Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. Stunning track along with friendly staff.

_Unknown_: The above two photos were taken together. As you can see from the second, Rich found it extremely funny that I had worn a suit to our bike ride. Sometimes it's good to look nice for these things.

_2020-03-08_: Rich bruised his knee riding this bike.

_2020-08-12_: This bike is called Streetfighter. Rich tricked me into riding. I assumed he wanted to play some arcade games.

_2021-02-14_: I was cooking Rich and I breakfast but we realised we had no eggs. Rich offered to ride us to the local farm shop.

_2021-10-31_: Scottish Highlands. I thought I could sneak a picture of the photographer.

_2021-08-23_: The photographer thought it would be clever to get a "cool" picture with a cat on the motorbike.

Of course this is all a lie. Rich **does** ride motorbikes and Rich **does** write for GQ. I however was bored one Christmas and decided to start a long-running gag of image editing myself into his pictures.
