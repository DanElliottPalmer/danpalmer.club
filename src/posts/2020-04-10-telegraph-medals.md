This graphic was created on behalf of the Telgraph Interactive team.

During the 2012 Olympics, our team was tasked with creating instant data graphics showing results of events as they finished. Whilst creating this work, we realised we could begin to collate and explore all of the results from previous Olympics too.

[![An interative graphic displaying Olympic medals](/projects/telegraph-olympic-medals.png)](/projects/telegraph-olympic-medals.png)

Our ambition with this graphics was to allow the reader to easily explore the distribution of medals for each country, in each discipline, in each year. In addition to this, the reader should be allowed to compare the different snapshots with another snapshot.

The graphic was built using Raphael.js with a lot of additional backend work to help process, structure and tidy the data.
